    <h1>Who to Blame: <br> Bad Products or Cranky Customers?</h1>

    <p>Some products get bad ratings in their reviews. It hurts but it's true.
        As online shoppers we tend to jump to the conclusion that the bad ratings reflect those products' poor quality.
        However, is that really the case? What if some of us really like to give low ratings and they happen to be the
        only ones who reviewed those allegedly "bad products"?
    </p>
    <br>


    <h2>Exploring Data</h2>
    <select id="data">
        <option value="./data/small.csv">small.csv</option>
        <option value="./data/medium.csv">medium.csv</option>
        <option value="./data/large.csv">large.csv</option>
    </select>
    <p>We start from the product side. With the online shopping data we have in hand,
        let's order them by their ratings:
    </p>
    <div id="products"></div>
    <p>We can see that poorly rated items' number of records may vary.
        If the item recieves numerous bad ratings, it is probably a bad product.
        However, if there's only one or two ratings and all of them are from cranky customers,
        the product might actually be a victim.
    </p>
    <p>In future steps we will focus on these short, red/yellow bars as they are potential "victims".</p>
    <br><br>


    <p>Now it's time to find out who are hardly satisfied. In other words,
        we are looking for reviewers who rate many but rate lowly:
    </p>
    <div id="reviewers"></div>
    <p>We will filter out everything else but leave the tall, yellow bars.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>Comprehending Data</h2>
    <p>According to the reasoning in the previous section, we filter the data based on the following criteria:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Filter out items that have good ratings (avg. rating > 2)</li>
        <li>Filter out reviewers who gives good raitngs on average (avg. rating > 2)</li>
        <li>Eliminate items that are considered bad by a number of people (rating count > 3)</li>
        <li>Leave reviewers who like to give low ratings (rating count > 3)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once we narrow down the collection, we can visualize the data using a heatmap:</p>
    <div id="heatmap"></div>
    <p>Each rectangle represents a rating of a product by a reviewer. The color of the rectangle
        corresponds to the average rating of the reviewer. With this visualization we can start to
        identify some of the products whose ratings are heavily influenced by biased reviewers.
        Products with only one deep red mark on its row suffer the most from these negative ratings,
        as the only ratings dictate the overall rating of the product.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>It is important that E-Commerce platforms take notice of this phenomenon. Their search
        algorithm need to account the fact that many lowly rated products with few comments
        are not necessarily inferior products. It should look for other factors, such as the number
        of comments, or whether the product is commented by biased users.
